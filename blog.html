				<p><b>Monday, March 14th 2016 - EnerNOC interview part 3! </b>As the school year is wrapping up, the search of summer employment/internship begins! I had attended the career fair a little over a week ago and submitted my resume, cover letters and socialized with recruiters from several companies. More specifically, EnerNOC, a company focused on better energy management, called me back the next day for an interview. The next day, I got all spruced up and was ready to turn the charm on. I signed in and took my seat as I was ready to be called upon. As I was looking over my notes and resumes I heard my name. I looked up to see a recruiter from the day before flag me over. We shook hands and I was formally introduced to Don Luchini. We went to a makeshift cubicle and went at it. I never had any real prior interview experience so I was a bundle of nerves. As the first few questions went by I felt more at ease. I presented myself and my interests as well as some of my external projects to Don. He seemed to take interest in them and speaking on these subjects were easy for me. I have a passion for these topics and became really engaged in conversation. Nearing the end of the interview I was asked if I was familiar with the boardgame Battleship. Don asked me some trivial questions such as if there were several subsequent hits, more than the most required to sinl the larges ship but no ships were sank, what did this mean? To which I replied, there would be ships laid next to one another and that there could be mixed orientation of several battle ships, so that many ships could be laid next to eachother in a vertical orientation. He then asked on how I would go about implementing a battleship AI, either offensive or defensive. For this I squirmed a bit and suggested that once a ship was hit, to check the 8 squares around it and after that, figure out orienation of that placement based off of the other two points. I also suggested for a dummy AI that when a successful shot was fired and hit, that the next shot would be 'wild' and go far astray to a random point. Don refuted that this actually wouldn't be a bad strategy as this would determine the whereabouts of several ships. This would allow the sinking of ships very quickly towards the end of the game due to getting few points to many ships. At the conclusion of the interview, Don said to expect something back by the upcoming week. A day or two went by and Ryan Fitzgerald, the software engineering manager, reached out to me. He invited me to a skype/phone call to introduce me to the company. Admittedly, I thought I had a foot in the door, it wound up being another interview. The day came and I was ready at my desktop with skype open. I answered the incoming phone call and introduced myself. We went over basic technical questions such as defining certain data structures and once again, going into more depth on my projects. At the conclusion, I asked about the next step in the process and Ryan told me that he could set up another interview with a couple members of the software engineering team to conduct a more technical interview. I was all in. Enter Katy, Jeff and Michael. I was contacted a few days after the interview with Ryan by Katy. She greeted me as my HR representative and one of my main contacts. We set up an agreed upon time for a skype interview and said that I would speaking with Jeff and Michael. This morning was the day. We connected the call and was greeted by their faces which threw me off guard. I immediately turned my webcam on as well, differing from Ryan's interview. I introduced myself and gave them a view into my background. We got right into it with technical questions, many of which were define and 'are you familiar with...' I stumbled a little bit more this time around with some of the questions. I was familiar with the concepts but had a hard time conveying some of my thoughts. There was an overarching focus on efficiency and http protocols. Big O notation came up and Jeff enlightened me on how to estimate the figure. [For loops are 'n', nested loops are 'n^#' where # are the number of nested cases] I was presented with two bigger technical questions; how to determine if there was an efficient way to determine if two strings were anagrams and how to optimize the spending of an allotment of $25 given an array of costs of items. For the first problem, I suggested a stack or appending to an array. I quickly ran into a wall when dealing with multiple instances of certain characters. Jeff gave the example of 'Tokyo' and 'Kyoto'. With a few revisions, I came to the conclusion that a dictionary would be a good structure with the keys of values being the number of occurences of that letter. Jeff then asked me to estimate the order of the function. I concluded that one for loop would be needed for each dictionary population so 2n or just n. For the store credit problem, Michael presented a $25 gift card and how to go about purchasing items with those items' prices in an array. I suggested traversing through the array but this would be the worst case scenario in that it would take multiple passes. Michael offered to have it sorted first which got me thinking. I then worked on an ascending priced list where the lower indices were cheaper items and the last element of the array would be the most expensive. I first suggested to simply add everything in the beginning of the array, keeping track of each element included and adding to ensure that $25 wasn't exceeded. I then offered another solution as maybe picking the lowest and then the highest index and comparing that addition to $25, if exceed move to the left of the upper index and keep the first element. I got a nod of approval and I asked closing questions such as to what a day in the life looks like. But it wasn't enough for me. I went to my scheduled classes afterward and was focused on those two questions. I had to get something coded up. <a href="https://github.com/zweed4u/InterviewQuestions/tree/master/EnerNOC">This is what I came up with</a>.</p>
				
				<p><b>Sunday, March 13th 2016 - Bad webdriver! Stay open!: </b>I have several scripts in python that require the Chromedriver. The gist of it is that I make some requests and transfer cookies from a session to a webdriver and open an instance of chrome with said cookies. Well I was finding that the webdriver was closing on my program's termination. I was befuddled. I opened up IDLE and emulated the script and the window stayed open, mind you that browser.close()/.exit() was never called. Come to find out, this was a patch due to security reasons as well as unintended results due to bleeding from test to test. I ran the command <b><i>pip freeze | grep selenium</i></b> this revealed the installed version as 2.52.0 I downgraded to see if it would yield the results I expected. I uninstalled and pointed pip to install a previous version with <b><i>sudo pip install -I selenium==2.48.0</i></b>. I ran my program and the window stayed open after completion from the command line.</p>

				<p><b>Friday, March 11th 2016 - Replacing the lightning connector and headphone jack on my iPhone 5S: </b> A few nights ago I woke up to the smell of that all too familar electrical burning smell. Half asleep and panic-stricken, I unplugged my phone from it's charger and nodded back to sleep assured that it was the issue. The next morning, upon further inspection, I was able to confirm that my suspicions were true. I looked at the bottom of the chassis of my phone and into the charging port and saw that one of the connector contacts looked damaged, almost as if it were burnt out. I went to amazon and purchased a replacement, the port, headphone jack, the whole shebang. <center><img src="images/originalPort.png"><br>Orginal port (missing contact - between 4th and '5th' contacts from left)</center><br>I installed the replacement when it came in and went to test its functionality. It wouldn't charge. After serveral reevaluations, I was confident in my procedure and was determined that it was due to defective hardware - it was purchased for ~$6.00 after all. So I purchased a similarly priced part from a different manufacturer. <br><center><img src="images/replacementAPort.png"><br>First purchased replacement - notice the correct number of gold contacts; 8. But faulty?</center><br>The newer replacement came in and I went through the same installation - by this time I was a whiz at it. Upon completion, I tested again. Still no dice! Was I installing something incorrectly? I had followed several guides online verbatim, (although none of which were well documented in the final steps). Being as confident in myself that I am, I was hard-pressed to blame myself. I know when I mess up and this wasn't one of those times. <center><img src="images/replacementBPort.png"><br>Second, newly purchased replacement - again, notice the correct number of gold contacts; 8. But <i>still</i> faulty?</center><br>Amidst troubleshooting, I became paranoid that the rear washers and braket of the connector were coming undone on placement of the new part and thusly, impeding charging functionality. <br><center><img src="images/placementInDevice.png"><br>Washers and brackets that are crucial to proper functionality. (marked via red dot)</center><br>But once again, I was confident that this was not the case. The brackets were present and in the right place upon installation. Was I missing something on the part? The new parts required transfer of several components from the original part, such as the boot/housing for the bottom microphone, the bracket for the home switch connection and the grounding bracket for the headphone jack, but was there more? <br><center><img src="images/backOfOriginal.png"><br>The rear view of the original part</center><br><center><img src="images/backOfReplacements.png"><br>The rear view of both replacement parts (first purchase on the left and second purchase on the right)</center><br>
Could it be the metallic washers also on the part itself? In the original, the four screw holes had thin metal washers around them. I noticed that in my first purchased repair part that this was not the case; just gold plated/copper? around the holes. (on left) But this issue wasn't present in my most recently purchased part. (on right) <center><i>What was going on?</i></center>
At this point I was just looking for the correct answer. After being some odd $13 in the hole, I had remembered that I had my girlfriend's old iPhone 5S from when she upgraded. I tore apart her phone and salvaged the lightning port and headphone jack. I installed the piece in the exact same manner as the previous 2 repair attempts noting the similar metallic washers on the back as in the original part and the second purchase from amazon. I booted it up and plugged in the charger and voila! Charging.<br>Could this have been an issue of defective aftermarket parts vs OEM? I don't know. But I am happy to have a phone that can charge again.</p>

				<p><b>Friday, March 11th 2016 - Setting up <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a> and unity desktop environment on my Lenovo 100s Chromebook: </b>I had received my chromebook in the mail today and was elated with its unboxing. I had recently purchased a Rapberry Pi 2 for the ability of computing without lugging a huge device around but it soon became an ornament on my desk continually running automated programs such as my <a href="https://github.com/zweed4u/XML-heartbeat">sitemap tweeter</a>. A chromebook sounded like the ideal deivce for me; light, and small all while packing a punch. I powered it on and was greeted with ChromeOS. I knew that I wasn't completely satisfied. Another reason why I was looking into chromebooks was the integration of linux with crouton. As a prerequisite, I put my chromebook in developer mode which was as easy as pressing the escape and refresh key. I was presented with your OS is missing prompt to which a ctrl+d bypassed. I then followed onscreen instructions. After that, I followed instructions from <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">here</a> and installed the unity desktop environment as xfce doesn't suit me. I guess I'll be busy installing packages and tweaking my machine to my liking for the next while.<br>NOTE: ctrl+d on startup everytime is somewhat annoying.</p>
