				<p><b>Monday, March 21st 2016 - Free Guac and Chips for everyone! </b>Chipotle is notorious for their promtions and various activities they run. Enter guachunter. Basically you have three rounds(chances) to spot the 5 differences in various pictures. I made use of the requests library and what I found out a little later on json. I completed a true game and inspected the request of a successful game. I grabbed requried headers and took note of the form data used in the POST. I went to coding and stumbled a bit. I kept getting an 'invalid header' string back in the response but 200 code. It was good, bu something about my payload was off. After searching high and low, I reviewed my steps and missed the fact that in the network tab, the type of the request was 'application/json'. It was posting JSON with the form data. A simple import and then json dumps call on the payload for the data and voila. I prettied it up and allowed for user input. <a href="http://github.com/zweed4u/freeGuacAndChips">Free Guac and Chips</a></p>

				<p><b>Monday, March 21st 2016 - END getting good </b>I wrote this in a previous blog but END clothing store has been changing their ways. I mentioned the microsite, lauches, but I didn't even check their main website which sits on magento's commerce platform. I tried to use an add to cart link and was greeted with the following screen: <br><center><img src="images/endBlock.png"><br>I laughed and was surprised. I was ready to use a vpn or proxy to get around my new ban but I navigated to their main shop's page and was in no way affected. I manually added a product to cart and inspected the network call. It seemed they used the same request but with a few more headers and in the payload there was an attribute selector for the sizing. It seems as though they did away with variants! I also took note of a new header 'X-Distil-Ajax:'. This seemed to be a random string and unlike the form key which was a quasi form of mitigation that was the same for a single session, X-Distil-Ajax seemed to be different for each product, making it much more difficult. I went to IDLE and tried to simulate a session with requests and urllib2. I blindly used urlopen and found that I was 403ed. Hmmm. I added some headers to my request which yielded better results but it wasn't fool proof. I implemented some fileIO and had the content of the page written to a file which I then made use of practiceboard.com to see what was going on. Sometimes I had an html file that was 30 or odd something lines that had javascript to which I knew would give these libraries some trouble. To remedy this I grabbed a cookie from a physical browser session and threw it in the header. This basically spoofed my session in python as the chromium window that I had opened. Having even further issues, in some more of my fileIO debugging output I was greeted with this little guy.<br><center><img src="images/theft-bot-home.png"><br>The html said that it was a javascript check, so I tinkered with the cookies noticing the different headers and values for each step in the process ranging from __cfuid to _wt. I ended up navigating page to page even implementing .get() from the session. It isn't 100% but I've made progress. On the cart call I get the following response:  {"success":0,"error":"Cannot add the item to shopping cart."} That sure is better than a block! Maybe I'm forming the final post request incorrectly. I'll have to give it some more thought. <br>**It also should be noted that I made use of soup.findAll() rather than the typical regex approach and I have to say, the case sensitivity of BeautifulSoup is somwhat frustrating.</p>


				<p><b>Monday, March 21st 2016 - Datto Inc. </b>In pursuit of my co-op and summer employment I researched several companies on my school's job postings. I stumbled accross Datto and was immediately enthralled. I'm big into automation and one of the main points in the candidate details was a familiarity with selenium; right up my alley. I applied online for a Software QA position and spoke with recruiters at my school's career fair. After several weeks I heard back and was offered a phone interview. I was ecstatic. I spoke with Chris, the director of QA. Right off the bat, I noticed his joviality. Unfortunately, I couldn't find myself at ease as I was so anxious in making a good first impression. I spoke about the pros and cons of Python and we spoke about how they really intend on moving from webdriver automation to api wrappers for more efficient and concise programs. I was asked on how to implement an api wrapper and Chris put it into an example(twitter) that I understood but I had trouble conveying a solution to him. Unknowingly, I make use of wrappers all of the time. (tweepy, and python-twitter). I stated that extensive documentation and example calls/requests would be beneficial to the average user. I shirked the question by stating referencing the api in a call and that I would think about it. But in hindsight, that's what it is. It's making an api more friendly for a user with several bundled methods making use of facets of the interface. As we concluded, I was asked my operating system to which I replied linux; more specifically, ubuntu. He asked what version and I said 12.04 on my chrooted chromebook and 14.04 on my main machine. To my surprise, they made use of the same distro and versions. He then wanted to assess my knowledge of the command line. Timidly and afraid of what he was about to ask I stated that I was proficient and brought up the Dunning-Kruger Effect. He asked how one would view hidden files. I stated '. files? Oh that would be ls -a. And you could pipe it with a grep command to find the file you wanted.' We then joked that others respond that they are familiar with the terminal and then use DIR as in windows directory listing command. The phone call ended and I was told that he would refer Jay, the director of automation infastructure, to me for a more technical call. Overall, I didn't perform as well as I knew I could but I was content.</p>

				<p><b>Saturday, March 19th 2016 - Um, bootloop? </b>I'm on Spring break for the next week and in so, I returned to the comfort of my home some 400 miles away from school. I spent the day with my father and prepped my brother for his baseball tryouts this Monday by hitting the cages. Afterward we hung out and I watched him play Borderlands on PS4. I have grown so far away. Not from just my family but myself. I have evolved. I used to be a big gamer but the desire just isn't there anymore. I enjoyed watching him get into it and then we went out for some fried seafood at a local restaurant, Dube's. After dinner we went to the bowling alley. Our intentions were to play some billiards but we ended up rolling a few strings. The first game I did horrible and then picked up the second game bowling a 93. This is candle pin by the way, so no big balls permitted! I go through how eventful the day was to show how in the moment I was. I returned to my mother's home and pulled out my phone. It was dead. I didn't even notice. I thought nothing of it and placed it on the charger. I returned to the outlet about an hour later and was greeted by a black screen and then, after some time, a boot logo. I was stuck. I knew it. I was in a bootloop and knew that I was to have my hands full for the next few hours. I attempted to boot in safe mode via mobile substrate by holding the volume up key on boot. I tried hard resetting and placing it in and out of DFU and recovery mode but nothing. I decided to let the battery drain completely overnight and try again in the morning. (Sometimes the battery percentage and brown-out detection conflict and results in an intermittent state where its, not dead but dead) Another idea I thought of was to charge whilst in DFU mode as it would charge more quickly with the off display. The next morning I bit the bullet and decided that it wasn't a hardware issue and that a restore was looking like the only viable option. I recalled that I received a flood of ptpd crash reports recently and thought it could be the culprit. I begrudingly downloaded iTunes on my mother's laptop because I only have my chromebook with me and remembered that I was 8.1.2. I went to the web and saw that Apple wasn't signing any previous firmware. This meant that I had to restore to the newest 9.2.1 and lose my jailbreak. Bleh. What are you going to do?</p>

				<p><b>Friday, March 18th 2016 - Welp, there goes my success with Magento: </b>END. Clothing had been a site I had much success in purchasing limited sneakers due to their eCommerce platform, Magento. With Magento, products and their available sizes were associated with variants in which one could be redirected to cart with a query string, (essentially a variable in a payload that would be bundled up in a POST request). As said, this request would redirect to your checkout cart sometimes hours before the product page was live. This allowed simple web scraping methods to essentially catalog and index all of their items. I had a single text file up to 5mb! Because they have a reverse proxy, more specifically CloudFlare, occasional temporary bans were placed on IP addresses as well as browser detection. These could be thwarted by vpn or use of set_proxy with the mechanize module. <= (I HIGHLY recommend by the way.) Headers to spoof User agent and other various attributes can be resolved with urrllib, and the requests library as well. Anywho, this bout went on a bit and then about a year ago, they implemented a form_key in the cart redirect link. This was easily circumvented as all it took was a preliminary product page visit to any already live item to acquire their respective form_key. (This changed based on cookies). Once the preliminary scrape was done, the form_key could be just thrown in a variable and then used in the url, which took in another variable, an integer, which would be incremented. This was the variant. Personally, I used regex on span tags after each increment/parse to display the variant and the item and size.<br>Now, END has something up their sleeves. They have implemented a microsite for special, limited releases. The process, to which I understand, is that you register/sign-up for each release you're interested in and come release time, END will email 'private' links to those subscribed/registered for the shoe. Size, address and other various information is required for registration. I ended up checking out the network calls on the main page. A few especially caught my eye involving the path/directory name, */api/*. I began tinkering and noticed that one request responded with a 500 code. I was puzzled. In the console, I was able to view the response but upon visiting in browser it returned 500. I took to python and urllib. I copied everything and the kitchen sink, even the cookie parameter in the header, since which has been removed as it is not needed. It returned a result but the page displayed a familiar \x1f string. This is a gzipped compressed response. A simple oneliner making use of the zlib library decodes the response. I prettied it up with json.loads to make use of the data structures in place instead of parsing a confusing string; add a nested for loop and voila! Name, colour, id, brand, release date/time, image thumbail for everything on there. I threw it in a hastebin and linked it in a tweet on my anonymous sneaker account to help others. My inbox was immediately flooded. Various errors for not having the required libraries, but one individual had an SSL error. This piqued my interest. I scp'ed the file from mu linux machine to my iphone. I fired up mobile terminal and the same error as my follower was thrown! <i><b>ssl routines:ssl23_get_server_hello:tlsv1 alert internal error</b></i> WIth some investigation I have come to the conclusion that it has to do with version of the installed openssl. Running <i><b>dpkg -l openssl</i></b> returned <i>1.0.1-4ubuntu5.35</i>. I went to my iphone the same command returned <i>0.9.8zg-13</i>. I guess I'll just settle on it being an issue of version co-requiste of openssl.</p>

				<p><b>Monday, March 14th 2016 - EnerNOC interview part 3! </b>As the school year is wrapping up, the search of summer employment/internship begins! I had attended the career fair a little over a week ago and submitted my resume, cover letters and socialized with recruiters from several companies. More specifically, EnerNOC, a company focused on better energy management, called me back the next day for an interview. The next day, I got all spruced up and was ready to turn the charm on. I signed in and took my seat as I was ready to be called upon. As I was looking over my notes and resumes I heard my name. I looked up to see a recruiter from the day before flag me over. We shook hands and I was formally introduced to Don Luchini. We went to a makeshift cubicle and went at it. I never had any real prior interview experience so I was a bundle of nerves. As the first few questions went by I felt more at ease. I presented myself and my interests as well as some of my external projects to Don. He seemed to take interest in them and speaking on these subjects were easy for me. I have a passion for these topics and became really engaged in conversation. Nearing the end of the interview I was asked if I was familiar with the boardgame Battleship. Don asked me some trivial questions such as if there were several subsequent hits, more than the most required to sinl the larges ship but no ships were sank, what did this mean? To which I replied, there would be ships laid next to one another and that there could be mixed orientation of several battle ships, so that many ships could be laid next to eachother in a vertical orientation. He then asked on how I would go about implementing a battleship AI, either offensive or defensive. For this I squirmed a bit and suggested that once a ship was hit, to check the 8 squares around it and after that, figure out orienation of that placement based off of the other two points. I also suggested for a dummy AI that when a successful shot was fired and hit, that the next shot would be 'wild' and go far astray to a random point. Don refuted that this actually wouldn't be a bad strategy as this would determine the whereabouts of several ships. This would allow the sinking of ships very quickly towards the end of the game due to getting few points to many ships. At the conclusion of the interview, Don said to expect something back by the upcoming week. A day or two went by and Ryan Fitzgerald, the software engineering manager, reached out to me. He invited me to a skype/phone call to introduce me to the company. Admittedly, I thought I had a foot in the door, it wound up being another interview. The day came and I was ready at my desktop with skype open. I answered the incoming phone call and introduced myself. We went over basic technical questions such as defining certain data structures and once again, going into more depth on my projects. At the conclusion, I asked about the next step in the process and Ryan told me that he could set up another interview with a couple members of the software engineering team to conduct a more technical interview. I was all in. Enter Katy, Jeff and Michael. I was contacted a few days after the interview with Ryan by Katy. She greeted me as my HR representative and one of my main contacts. We set up an agreed upon time for a skype interview and said that I would speaking with Jeff and Michael. This morning was the day. We connected the call and was greeted by their faces which threw me off guard. I immediately turned my webcam on as well, differing from Ryan's interview. I introduced myself and gave them a view into my background. We got right into it with technical questions, many of which were define and 'are you familiar with...' I stumbled a little bit more this time around with some of the questions. I was familiar with the concepts but had a hard time conveying some of my thoughts. There was an overarching focus on efficiency and http protocols. Big O notation came up and Jeff enlightened me on how to estimate the figure. [For loops are 'n', nested loops are 'n^#' where # are the number of nested cases] I was presented with two bigger technical questions; how to determine if there was an efficient way to determine if two strings were anagrams and how to optimize the spending of an allotment of $25 given an array of costs of items. For the first problem, I suggested a stack or appending to an array. I quickly ran into a wall when dealing with multiple instances of certain characters. Jeff gave the example of 'Tokyo' and 'Kyoto'. With a few revisions, I came to the conclusion that a dictionary would be a good structure with the keys of values being the number of occurences of that letter. Jeff then asked me to estimate the order of the function. I concluded that one for loop would be needed for each dictionary population so 2n or just n. For the store credit problem, Michael presented a $25 gift card and how to go about purchasing items with those items' prices in an array. I suggested traversing through the array but this would be the worst case scenario in that it would take multiple passes. Michael offered to have it sorted first which got me thinking. I then worked on an ascending priced list where the lower indices were cheaper items and the last element of the array would be the most expensive. I first suggested to simply add everything in the beginning of the array, keeping track of each element included and adding to ensure that $25 wasn't exceeded. I then offered another solution as maybe picking the lowest and then the highest index and comparing that addition to $25, if exceed move to the left of the upper index and keep the first element. I got a nod of approval and I asked closing questions such as to what a day in the life looks like. But it wasn't enough for me. I went to my scheduled classes afterward and was focused on those two questions. I had to get something coded up. <a href="https://github.com/zweed4u/InterviewQuestions/tree/master/EnerNOC">This is what I came up with</a>.</p>
				
				<p><b>Sunday, March 13th 2016 - Bad webdriver! Stay open!: </b>I have several scripts in python that require the Chromedriver. The gist of it is that I make some requests and transfer cookies from a session to a webdriver and open an instance of chrome with said cookies. Well I was finding that the webdriver was closing on my program's termination. I was befuddled. I opened up IDLE and emulated the script and the window stayed open, mind you that browser.close()/.exit() was never called. Come to find out, this was a patch due to security reasons as well as unintended results due to bleeding from test to test. I ran the command <b><i>pip freeze | grep selenium</i></b> this revealed the installed version as 2.52.0 I downgraded to see if it would yield the results I expected. I uninstalled and pointed pip to install a previous version with <b><i>sudo pip install -I selenium==2.48.0</i></b>. I ran my program and the window stayed open after completion from the command line.</p>				

				<p><b>Saturday, March 12th 2016 - Getting mitmproxy running in my chrooted system - many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/AntonioLangiu/ch-roomebook">AntonioLangiu</a>: </b>place text and image here.</p>

				<p><b>Friday, March 11th 2016 - Replacing the lightning connector and headphone jack on my iPhone 5S: </b> A few nights ago I woke up to the smell of that all too familar electrical burning smell. Half asleep and panic-stricken, I unplugged my phone from it's charger and nodded back to sleep assured that it was the issue. The next morning, upon further inspection, I was able to confirm that my suspicions were true. I looked at the bottom of the chassis of my phone and into the charging port and saw that one of the connector contacts looked damaged, almost as if it were burnt out. I went to amazon and purchased a replacement, the port, headphone jack, the whole shebang. <center><img src="images/originalPort.png"><br>Orginal port (missing contact - between 4th and '5th' contacts from left)</center><br>I installed the replacement when it came in and went to test its functionality. It wouldn't charge. After serveral reevaluations, I was confident in my procedure and was determined that it was due to defective hardware - it was purchased for ~$6.00 after all. So I purchased a similarly priced part from a different manufacturer. <br><center><img src="images/replacementAPort.png"><br>First purchased replacement - notice the correct number of gold contacts; 8. But faulty?</center><br>The newer replacement came in and I went through the same installation - by this time I was a whiz at it. Upon completion, I tested again. Still no dice! Was I installing something incorrectly? I had followed several guides online verbatim, (although none of which were well documented in the final steps). Being as confident in myself that I am, I was hard-pressed to blame myself. I know when I mess up and this wasn't one of those times. <center><img src="images/replacementBPort.png"><br>Second, newly purchased replacement - again, notice the correct number of gold contacts; 8. But <i>still</i> faulty?</center><br>Amidst troubleshooting, I became paranoid that the rear washers and braket of the connector were coming undone on placement of the new part and thusly, impeding charging functionality. <br><center><img src="images/placementInDevice.png"><br>Washers and brackets that are crucial to proper functionality. (marked via red dot)</center><br>But once again, I was confident that this was not the case. The brackets were present and in the right place upon installation. Was I missing something on the part? The new parts required transfer of several components from the original part, such as the boot/housing for the bottom microphone, the bracket for the home switch connection and the grounding bracket for the headphone jack, but was there more? <br><center><img src="images/backOfOriginal.png"><br>The rear view of the original part</center><br><center><img src="images/backOfReplacements.png"><br>The rear view of both replacement parts (first purchase on the left and second purchase on the right)</center><br>
Could it be the metallic washers also on the part itself? In the original, the four screw holes had thin metal washers around them. I noticed that in my first purchased repair part that this was not the case; just gold plated/copper? around the holes. (on left) But this issue wasn't present in my most recently purchased part. (on right) <center><i>What was going on?</i></center>
At this point I was just looking for the correct answer. After being some odd $13 in the hole, I had remembered that I had my girlfriend's old iPhone 5S from when she upgraded. I tore apart her phone and salvaged the lightning port and headphone jack. I installed the piece in the exact same manner as the previous 2 repair attempts noting the similar metallic washers on the back as in the original part and the second purchase from amazon. I booted it up and plugged in the charger and voila! Charging.<br>Could this have been an issue of defective aftermarket parts vs OEM? I don't know. But I am happy to have a phone that can charge again.</p>

				<p><b>Friday, March 11th 2016 - Setting up <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a> and unity desktop environment on my Lenovo 100s Chromebook: </b>I had received my chromebook in the mail today and was elated with its unboxing. I had recently purchased a Rapberry Pi 2 for the ability of computing without lugging a huge device around but it soon became an ornament on my desk continually running automated programs such as my <a href="https://github.com/zweed4u/XML-heartbeat">sitemap tweeter</a>. A chromebook sounded like the ideal deivce for me; light, and small all while packing a punch. I powered it on and was greeted with ChromeOS. I knew that I wasn't completely satisfied. Another reason why I was looking into chromebooks was the integration of linux with crouton. As a prerequisite, I put my chromebook in developer mode which was as easy as pressing the escape and refresh key. I was presented with your OS is missing prompt to which a ctrl+d bypassed. I then followed onscreen instructions. After that, I followed instructions from <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">here</a> and installed the unity desktop environment as xfce doesn't suit me. I guess I'll be busy installing packages and tweaking my machine to my liking for the next while.<br>NOTE: ctrl+d on startup everytime is somewhat annoying.</p>
